This is a description of the program for the logistic regression problem for the Cancer.
B stands for Benign and M stands for Malignant
first of all have it in mind that there are several versions of dataset for the problem. If you are working on this problem, use the dataset named"data"
Our dataset has 2 colomns that must be dropped as they ruin the regression. id & unnamed :32
Then we used train_test split from sklearn to split the data to train and test sections
Then we introfuce our model which is LogisticRegression()
Then at the end we make our confusion matrix to make a comparison between the y-test and predicted values.
